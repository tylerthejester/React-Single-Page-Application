# React-Single-Page-Application

## Description

This is the project for the "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course, focusing on single-page application using same-page linking approach. The purpose is to quickly switch between sections instead of loading entire new pages.

## How to run

• Fork this repo to your GitHub <br />
• Clone your repo <br />
• Run your cloned files with any localhost that you set up on your computer

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

This project is only for the discussion of the course, but the concept will be applied further to my portfolio, as I am considering to switch between projects more quickly.
